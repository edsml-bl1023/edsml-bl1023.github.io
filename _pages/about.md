## Short Bio

I am currently a PhD student in the Department of Geography at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU), supervised by Prof. Meng Gao. My research focuses on climate–aerosol interactions and the application of machine learning methods in climate modeling. This website documents my research progress, academic activities, and selected outputs.

## Research Interests

- Climate modeling and Earth system modeling  
- Aerosol–radiation interactions  
- Dust optical properties and mineralogy  
- Machine learning for atmospheric and climate applications  
- Satellite remote sensing of precipitation and air quality

## Education

- **2024.09 – present**, PhD Student, Department of Geography, Hong Kong Baptist University  
- **2023.09 – 2024.09**, MSc, Environmental Data Science and Machine Learning, Imperial College London  
- **2019.09 – 2023.06**, BSc, Atmospheric Sciences (Joint Degree), University of Reading & Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology

## Research Experience

During my undergraduate studies, I worked on satellite-based precipitation retrieval under the supervision of **Prof. Emily Black** and **Dr. Ross Maidment** (University of Reading). At Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST), I conducted research on tropical cyclones and precipitation under the supervision of **Prof. Ying Wu**.

At Imperial College London, under the supervision of **Dr. César Quilodrán-Casas** (Imperial College London) and **Dr. Laura Anne Mansfield** (Stanford University), I explored integrating machine learning with climate model outputs.

Currently, under the supervision of **Prof. Meng Gao** at HKBU, my PhD research investigates climate–aerosol interactions using climate models, with an emphasis on dust optical properties and radiative effects.
